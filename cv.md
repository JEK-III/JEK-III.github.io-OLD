### CLIR/DLF postdoctoral fellowship in data curation for the sciences and social sciences

Supervisor: Dr. Carly Strasser

* Comprehensively reviewed new and ongoing data publication initiatives; published the findings as an article in F1000Research.
* Surveyed researcher practices and perceptions relating to data publication to inform initiatives at the California Digital Library and beyond.
